# WealthTrack — Investment Portfolio Tracker

A Django web application for tracking personal investments across stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, and more.
Users can manage multiple portfolios, log transactions, and monitor their holdings from a single dashboard.

> 🚧 **Active Development** — Authentication is working. Portfolio models and dashboard are in progress.

---

## What Makes This Different

Most portfolio trackers only handle stocks. WealthTrack is designed for multiple asset classes — stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, gold, fixed deposits, and more.

Holdings are **derived from transactions**, not stored manually — the same way real financial systems work.
Buy 10 TCS, sell 2 TCS → current holding is automatically 8 TCS.
